# NeqSim for process simulation
NeqSim process is part of the [NeqSim project](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/). 
The NeqSim process project uses neqsim as basis for developing process simulation models. Examples of use of the process models are given in the example directory.

Java and Python files for creation of the processes are given in the src directory as well as generated neqsim process binary files *.neqsim stored in the src/resource directory.
The process calculations are typically run from python by opening the process files from the src/resorces directory. Documentation of how to do proces simulation in Python is found in the doc folder.

# Requirements
The neqsim python package needs to be installed to run the examples in Python. NeqSim is installed using pip install neqsim.
